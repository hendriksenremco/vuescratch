    <h1>About VueScratch</h1>
    <p>
      VueScratch is a site all about building awesome Vue applications.
      Encouraging developers to build more functionality from scratch, without
      the need of an external framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is extremely fun to get things done yourself, and it gives you the most
      control over the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be posting small chunks of code which i build for this site, but
      also make some series which covers building bigger applications. I hope
      you will enjoy my content and if you got some to say to me, contact me
      remco@vuescratch.com
